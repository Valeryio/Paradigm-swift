Integrate this website that you'll find [here](https://html5up.net/uploads/demos/paradigm-shift/), in HTML, CSS and javascript.

### Links

- Template URL: [Get the Template](https://html5up.net/uploads/demos/paradigm-shift/)

## My process
This time, I choosed to build the mobile first, with only CSS, and then add the rest!


### Built with

- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript (a little bit...)
- Full responsive method


### What I learned

Grid are useful to both vertical and horizontal disposition, but flex are more useful
for linearisation, and UI elements!

### Continued development

- Deep understanding of grid, box and layout

### Useful resources
- [MDN font Styling article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals)
